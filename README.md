# SwiftGPX

SwiftGPX is a Swift library for parsing GPX (GPS Exchange Format) files. It provides structs that conform to Codable
and can be coded using the `XMLCoder` library. It also provides an easy way to create GPX files from scratch which can
be useful for generating GPX files programmatically.

> **Note:** This library is a work-in-progress and may not support all GPX features. Please feel free to contribute to 
> extend the functionality.

## Contribution

If you have any ideas on how to take this further I'm happy to discuss things in an issue.
